# Training Birds Simulation!


## This simulation, built in the p5.js Javascript framework, animates a self-created, specialized, Genetic Algorithm to "teach" an artificial Flock of Birds how to fly towards a target accurately!

### Using a modified version of the algorithm discussed and researched by NYU professor Daniel Shiffman, my genetic algorithm utilizes DNA Data Structures and implements Synthetic Learning Models to simulate Natural Selection within the generations of the Birds.
The intended purpose is the animate the process and showcase the various applications of the Genetic Algorithm at play here.
