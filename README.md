## Overview

This project is a sophisticated simulation built in the p5.js framework that visualizes evolutionary algorithms in action. It demonstrates how genetic algorithms can be used to optimize navigation behavior in a simulated flock of birds, allowing them to efficiently reach a target destination.

## Technical Implementation

### Genetic Algorithm Architecture

The simulation implements a specialized genetic algorithm with the following components:

- **DNA Data Structures**: Each bird possesses a unique genetic code that determines its navigation behavior
- **Natural Selection Mechanisms**: Birds that perform better (reach targets faster) have higher chances of passing their genes to subsequent generations
- **Mutation Variables**: Small random variations in genetic code allow for evolutionary exploration
- **Fitness Evaluation**: Birds are scored based on their ability to navigate efficiently

### Learning Model

The implementation builds upon foundational research by NYU professor Daniel Shiffman, with several custom modifications to enhance the learning process:

- **Generational Learning**: Each generation of birds builds upon the collective "knowledge" of previous generations
- **Adaptive Selection Pressure**: Selection intensity adjusts based on population performance
- **Visual Representation**: Real-time visualization of the evolutionary process

## Applications

This simulation demonstrates practical applications of genetic algorithms including:

- Path optimization problems
- Autonomous navigation systems
- Emergent behavior in multi-agent systems
- Visualization of evolutionary computation principles

## Purpose

Beyond its technical implementation, this project serves as an educational tool that:

1. Illustrates evolutionary algorithms in an accessible, visual format
2. Demonstrates how simple rules can lead to complex adaptive behaviors
3. Provides a framework for understanding optimization through simulated natural selection

## Technologies

- **p5.js**: Core visualization and animation framework
- **Custom GA Library**: Purpose-built genetic algorithm implementation
- **HTML5/CSS3**: Interface and styling
- **JavaScript**: Core programming language
